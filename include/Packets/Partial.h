        // 4.2.1.  Old Format Packet Lengths
        //
        //     The meaning of the length-type in old format packets is:
        //
        //     ...
        //
        //
        //     3 - The packet is of indeterminate length.  The header is 1 octet
        //         long, and the implementation must determine how long the packet
        //         is.  If the packet is in a file, this means that the packet
        //         extends until the end of the file.  In general, an implementation
        //         SHOULD NOT use indeterminate-length packets except where the end
        //         of the data will be clear from the context, and even then it is
        //         better to use a definite length, or a new format header.  The new
        //         format headers described below have a mechanism for precisely
        //         encoding data of indeterminate length.

        // 4.2.2.4.  Partial Body Lengths
        //
        //     A Partial Body Length header is one octet long and encodes the length
        //     of only part of the data packet.  This length is a power of 2, from 1
        //     to 1,073,741,824 (2 to the 30th power).  It is recognized by its one
        //     octet value that is greater than or equal to 224, and less than 255.
        //     The Partial Body Length is equal to:
        //
        //         partialBodyLen = 1 << (1st_octet & 0x1F);
        //
        //     Each Partial Body Length header is followed by a portion of the
        //     packet body data.  The Partial Body Length header specifies this
        //     portion's length.  Another length header (one octet, two-octet,
        //     five-octet, or partial) follows that portion.  The last length header
        //     in the packet MUST NOT be a Partial Body Length header.  Partial Body
        //     Length headers may only be used for the non-final parts of the
        //     packet.
        //
        //     Note also that the last Body Length header can be a zero-length
        //     header.
        //
        //     An implementation MAY use Partial Body Lengths for data packets, be
        //     they literal, compressed, or encrypted.  The first partial length
        //     MUST be at least 512 octets long.  Partial Body Lengths MUST NOT be
        //     used for any other packet types.
