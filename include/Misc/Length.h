    //     This type of length header is recognized because the one octet value
    //     is less than 192. The body length is equal to:

    //
    //     A two-octet Body Length header encodes a length of 192 to 8383
    //     octets. It is recognized because its first octet is in the range 192
    //     to 223. The body length is equal to:
    //
    //         bodyLen = ((1st_octet - 192) << 8) + (2nd_octet) + 192

    //
    //     2 - The packet has a four-octet length. The header is 5 octets long.
    //
    // 4.2.2.3. Five-Octet Lengths
    //
    //     A five-octet Body Length header consists of a single octet holding
    //     the value 255, followed by a four-octet scalar. The body length is
    //     equal to:
    //
    //         bodyLen = (2nd_octet << 24) | (3rd_octet << 16) |
    //                   (4th_octet << 8) | 5th_octet
    //
    //     This basic set of one, two, and five-octet lengths is also used
    //     internally to some packets.
    //

    // 4.2.1. Old Format Packet Lengths
    //
    //     3 - The packet is of indeterminate length. The header is 1 octet
    //         long, and the implementation must determine how long the packet
    //         is. If the packet is in a file, this means that the packet
    //         extends until the end of the file. In general, an implementation
    //         SHOULD NOT use indeterminate-length packets except where the end
    //         of the data will be clear from the context, and even then it is
    //         better to use a definite length, or a new format header. The new
    //         format headers described below have a mechanism for precisely
    //         encoding data of indeterminate length.
    //
    // 4.2.2.4. Partial Body Lengths
    //
    //     A Partial Body Length header is one octet long and encodes the length
    //     of only part of the data packet. This length is a power of 2, from 1
    //     to 1,073,741,824 (2 to the 30th power). It is recognized by its one
    //     octet value that is greater than or equal to 224, and less than 255.
    //     The Partial Body Length is equal to:
    //
    //         partialBodyLen = 1 << (1st_octet & 0x1F);
    //
    //     Each Partial Body Length header is followed by a portion of the
    //     packet body data. The Partial Body Length header specifies this
    //     portionâ€™s length. Another length header (one octet, two-octet,
    //     five-octet, or partial) follows that portion. The last length header
    //     in the packet MUST NOT be a Partial Body Length header. Partial Body
    //     Length headers may only be used for the non-final parts of the
    //     packet.
    //
    //     Note also that the last Body Length header can be a zero-length
    //     header.
    //
    //     An implementation MAY use Partial Body Lengths for data packets, be
    //     they literal, compressed, or encrypted. The first partial length
    //     MUST be at least 512 octets long. Partial Body Lengths MUST NOT be
    //     used for any other packet types.
    //

    std::size_t read_partialBodyLen(uint8_t first_octet, const Packet::HeaderFormat);
